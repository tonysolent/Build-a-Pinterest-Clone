# pinterest-clone

This is the final full-stack project in the Freecodecamp curriculum. The instructions and requirements can be found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pinterest-clone">here</a>.
It's a Pinterest-style application where a user can look at pictures that other people have linked to. A user can sign in with twitter
which gives him/her the ability to link to pictures of their own and like other people's images. The pictures are
not uploaded but linked, so loading times can vary.

The application was build using NodeJS on the server, with mongoDB (using mongoose) as database. I used passportJS for authentication.
The frontend was built using React and Redux. This was the first project I built using Redux. It went okay.
